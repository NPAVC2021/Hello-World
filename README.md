# Hello-World

Hello, my name is Avion, I am making this repository for school and as a project. I would like to briefly give my outlook as to why I am doing this. I am a cybersecurity student in Federal Law and that means that from here on out everything will be according to the Law. There will be no longer any malicious acts from any type of threat actor that uses the internet from unappropriate reason.
According to the Law, you will be subject to fines and imprisonment if there are things wrongfully done while using the internet.
That being said, let's have some fun and make cybersecurity a job and lets all get paid to do this from here on out, I believe we all can get paid on these types of jobs and I need a huge payout.
Also, I am not the greatest at coding, anyone who has access to this repository can mess with it and make things happen.
